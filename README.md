# LearningPygame
I have started learning pygame from today so instead of writing notes i am using this format of writing comments (lots and lots of for practice)
In basicsGame.py I was learning fron the documentation of pygame and I was learning about how pixels moved using list and code which will help me learn more about working of blit().
